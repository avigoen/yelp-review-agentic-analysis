Now I have friends just to the east of this intersection and I NEVER noticed this place before.  In an empty shopping center (basically) and very nondescript.\\\\n\\\\nSo we walk in and I was like OK. Tiny place, limited seating and two steps you are at the sushi bar.  Ambiance I learned is not why you  go here.\\\\n\\\\nSat down and learned its always HAPPY HOUR at Taiko.  So good priced rolls and Saki Bombers for $6.99.  Good deal.\\\\n\\\\nI had my two kids with me (along with my wife) and besides a Cali roll none of them are Sushi eaters.  My daughter LOVED the Miso Soup I tasted it and it was very good also. She also got the Chicken Katsu which was very good.\\\\n\\\\nMy son raved about the Cali roll he took that down in about 3 minutes flat.  My wife went with the beef teryiaki and the meat was actually cooked medium rare.  I was shocked.  It was good and flavorful.  So that part was for the non-Japanese eaters you may have.\\\\n\\\\nI decided to have a feast.  I tried their Blue Fin Tuna, which was spectacular, had some great yellow tail, some of the freshest I have had since moving here.  Followed that up with my all time favorite sushi which is spicy scallops.  And they were spicy and tasty.  Loved them.  I also tried the Salmon Dynamite roll.  While something I may not order again, it was very good and had different flavor.  While eating my wife was reading review and said the fun is trying something new like Hamachi Kama.  Now this is one of my all time favorite dishes and asked for an order.  The watiress was like, you like Hamachi Kama and smiled?  Within a few minutes the owner brought it over with an even bigger smile.  It was great.\\\\n\\\\nJust a quick stepback, as we walked in my youngest said dad do you like your birthday restaurant.  I laughed and said yes.  Well a waitress must of heard that and after finishing dinner the owner proudly brought over a dessert proclaimed happy bday and on the house.  Very very nice touch.\\\\n\\\\nI will be back..again..and again...and again...Best Sushi I have found in the South Valley BY FAR!',\n",
